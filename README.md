# kandev-provider-usage

A [kandev](https://github.com/kdlbs/kandev) plugin that shows **subscription
utilization** for your agent providers — how much of each rate-limit window
(5-hour / weekly / monthly …) is used, with reset times — in the shared page-wide
and session top bars and, when enabled, Kandev's global status bar. Data comes from the
[codexbar](https://github.com/steipete/codexbar) CLI (covers ~60 providers:
Claude, Codex/OpenAI, Gemini, Copilot, Cursor, Grok, OpenCode, …) plus
Augment's own Analytics API.

## Screenshots

A pill in the shared page-wide top bar (`main-top-bar` slot) and session top
bar (`chat-top-bar` slot) shows the selected provider as an icon + %:

Hover it to open a panel that cycles through every provider. Click a tab to
select it; the pill updates immediately and that selection persists
across app/browser restarts. If it is unavailable, the panel falls back to the
current session's provider, then the first available provider.

Augment shows month-to-date consumption against a budget, plus average/day and
a projected month-end total:

## What it does

### MCP agent tool

The plugin exposes the read-only MCP tool
`kandev_kandev_provider_usage_get_provider_usage` on Kanban and Office task
surfaces. It returns the existing instance-wide, non-user-scoped background
snapshot; Kandev supplies the invocation workspace identity and callers cannot
select a workspace, account, session, or credential.

Calls never run codexbar or contact provider APIs. They return cached telemetry
with generation time, age, and a stale flag (at twice the configured polling
interval); before the first poll, the tool returns a well-formed partial
response. Availability values distinguish available, quota exhaustion, stale
telemetry, unavailable providers, missing configuration, unsupported providers,
and unknown errors. The structured result contains only normalized metadata and
never raw provider errors, account identifiers, or credentials.

Coordinators should poll no more frequently than the configured interval. Use
the UI Refresh action when a fresh provider read is needed.

- **Shared and session top bars (default)**: the same widget in `main-top-bar`
  (Home/Kanban, Tasks, and Threads) and the existing `chat-top-bar` plugin slot
  (kandev ≥ [#1827](https://github.com/kdlbs/kandev/pull/1827)) — a pill for
  your selected provider (icon + %), each real brand mark rendered monochrome.
  Hover to open a panel that cycles through every provider; click to switch,
  and the selected tab is remembered locally.
  The shared bar has no task or active session: it reads the same account-wide
  snapshots and uses the saved provider, then the first available provider.
  In a session, the current provider remains the fallback before the first
  available one. On phones, open the listing menu and tap the pill to expand
  usage inline; provider tabs and Refresh have 44 px minimum touch targets.
- **Global status display (opt-in)**: `display_status_bar_mode` chooses `off`
  (default), `percentage`, `meter`, or `both`. The contribution in
  `app-status-bar-right` renders the selected compact presentation plus reset
  context; hover opens the same full provider panel as the session top-bar
  pill. It adapts to the host's 24 px desktop/tablet bar and its phone Status
  drawer. It is global provider/account usage only; session IDs only help
  resolve `current`.
- Each provider's panel shows its rate-limit windows as thin bars (calm indigo
  normally, warming to amber/coral only when high — never a hard red), a
  reset countdown, plan/source badges, and codexbar's pace summary
  ("48% in reserve").
- **Codex manual resets**: the provider panel and phone Status drawer show
  available reset credits separately from the scheduled quota countdowns.
  A compact summary shows the available count and nearest expiry. Click, tap,
  or use the keyboard to expand the inventory, sorted soonest first, with
  calendar dates and exact local timestamps. Redeemed, expired, and
  unknown-status credits are excluded. Credits without an expiry show
  "Expiry not reported". Count-only reports stay count-only; Win-CodexBar
  supplies a summary and the next expiry.
  Missing reset data leaves the section hidden, while a reported zero is shown
  as zero. This is display-only; the plugin does not redeem credits.
- **Augment** is a special case: codexbar can't read it off macOS, so it's
  fetched directly from Augment's Analytics API. Shows month-to-date
  consumption as a used-of-budget bar (defaulting to a 2.5M-credit budget for
  credit plans so it always renders a bar), plus average-per-day and a
  projected month-end total.
- **A background poller** refreshes a single snapshot of every provider every
  few minutes (configurable); the pill and panel always serve that snapshot
  instantly — codexbar/Augment only run on the timer or an explicit
  **Refresh**. Each refresh tries codexbar's fast `oauth` source first, falling
  back to the agent CLI only when needed.
- **No cookies / web login required**: utilization is read from your local
  provider credentials (`~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, …) for the OAuth agents.

## codexbar distribution

codexbar ships per-platform release binaries (no npm/npx). The plugin resolves
the CLI in this order:

1. the **codexbar command** you set in Settings (a path, e.g.
   `/usr/local/bin/codexbar`);
2. a `codexbar` binary on `PATH`;
3. otherwise it **downloads a pinned build once**, verifies it against a
   bundled SHA-256, and caches it under `~/.config/kandev-provider-usage`.
   Linux uses upstream's fully static musl builds so it does not depend on the
   host's glibc version. macOS uses the native builds.

Upstream codexbar publishes no Windows CLI. Windows instead downloads the CLI
from [Win-CodexBar](https://github.com/nesszer/Win-CodexBar), a third-party port
that publishes a compatible `codexbar-cli.exe`; it is pinned and SHA-256 verified
the same way, and versioned separately because that port cuts its own releases.
The CLI ZIP is currently unsigned, so the pinned checksum does not replace code
signing or the need to trust the release publisher.
Nothing has to be installed by hand on any platform.

To update a managed CLI:

1. Open **Settings → Plugins → Provider Usage**.
2. Click **Update CodexBar** in the **Integration status** card.
3. Wait for the version and success message to appear (up to two minutes).

This explicitly opts into the latest stable release from the platform's release
repository. The plugin verifies the archive against GitHub's SHA-256 asset digest
and checks `--version` before selecting it. The selected version persists across
plugin restarts; normal refreshes reuse it without checking GitHub. The original
pinned build remains the default until you update. Previous binaries stay on disk,
and a failed download, verification, startup check, or selection write keeps the
previous version selected. **Re-check** refreshes status and usage; it does not
upgrade the CLI.

For a CLI configured in settings or found on `PATH`, update it with its existing
installation method. The plugin does not replace externally managed binaries.

When that fails, the plugin doesn't just go quiet: the **Integration status**
card on the settings page shows which of those three paths was tried, the raw
cause (including the failed command's first stderr line), and a hint naming the
fix — no outbound access to github.com, a checksum mismatch, an unwritable
cache directory, an unsupported platform, or a configured path that isn't
executable. The download is retried on every refresh, so a transient failure
clears itself on the next poll or on **re-check**.

## Settings

Settings → Plugins → Provider Usage (generated from the manifest
`config_schema`, grouped by source):

| Key                       | Meaning                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `augment_api_token`        | Augment Analytics service-account token (stored as a secret — masked in the UI). Enables the Augment card. Create one at [app.augmentcode.com/settings/personal-api-tokens](https://app.augmentcode.com/settings/personal-api-tokens). |
| `augment_email`             | Your Augment org email, used to filter Analytics to your usage.                                             |
| `augment_monthly_budget`    | Budget for the used-of-budget %. Empty = a per-user Analytics override, else a 2,500,000-credit default.   |
| `augment_resource`          | `credits` (default) or `usd` — which metric your Augment plan bills.                                        |
| `codexbar_command`          | Explicit codexbar command. Empty = auto-detect / auto-download.                                             |
| `codexbar_poll_minutes`     | Background refresh interval (default 5, minimum 1).                                                          |
| `codexbar_providers`        | Comma-separated provider ids to poll. Empty = curated local-credential set; `"all"` = full sweep (slower).  |
| `display_pill_providers`    | Providers included in the optional global status display, comma-separated. Tokens: `current`, `all`, or explicit ids. Empty = current session's provider only. The top-bar pills instead follow the locally remembered tab selection. |
| `display_status_bar_mode`   | `off` (default) keeps usage in the top bars only. `percentage` adds icon + percentage to global status; `meter` adds icon + meter without percentage; `both` adds meter + percentage. Enabled modes also appear in the phone Status drawer. Requires a Kandev host with app-status-bar slots. |
| `display_threshold_warn`    | A window at/above this % turns amber (default 75).                                                            |
| `display_threshold_high`    | A window at/above this % turns red/coral (default 90).                                                        |

Saving settings restarts the plugin, so changes take effect immediately; the
panel also has a **Refresh** button for an on-demand update.

Below the settings form, an **Integration status** card shows live health at a
glance — whether the codexbar CLI resolved (with version, how it was found, and
the binary in use) and whether the Augment Analytics API is reachable — with a
re-check button. It renders inline via the host's `plugin-settings` slot.

When codexbar isn't working the card explains why: `missing` when no binary
could be resolved (download blocked, unsupported platform, checksum mismatch),
`not working` when one was found but wouldn't run. Both show the raw error plus
the next step to take. The same reason also appears in the hover panel, so a
blank pill explains itself without a trip to Settings.

## Layout

- `manifest.yaml` — three GET webhooks (`status`, `providers`, `overview`), the
  UI bundle, the `api_read: ["sessions"]` capability (to resolve the current
  session's agent → provider server-side), and the grouped `config_schema`.
- `server/` — Go backend half (`pluginsdk.Plugin`), spawned by kandev over the
  gRPC plugin contract. Runs a background poller that shells out to codexbar
  (and, when configured, calls Augment's Analytics API directly) and caches a
  snapshot; webhooks serve that snapshot instantly.
- `ui/bundle.js` — hand-written, no-build ES module using the shared host React
  instance and `host.ui` components, plus inlined real brand-mark SVGs
  (monochrome). It registers shared and compatibility chat top-bar, plugin
  settings, and opt-in global status-right components, and only renders backend payloads.

## Develop

Requires a sibling checkout of the kandev monorepo at `../kandev` (see the
`replace` directive in `go.mod`).

```sh
make test           # Go + UI-bundle tests (codexbar/Augment calls are injected — no network needed)
make package-host   # tarball for this machine only (fast iteration)
make package         # tarball for all 5 supported platforms
```

Install the tarball via Settings → Plugins → Install plugin (upload), or:

```sh
curl -F package=@kandev-provider-usage-0.8.0.tar.gz \
  http://localhost:8080/api/plugins/install
```

## Release

In **Actions → release**, run the workflow from `main` and choose a
patch, minor, or major bump. It commits the version update and generated
`CHANGELOG.md` directly to `main`, tags that commit as `vX.Y.Z`, then verifies
(`fmt`/`vet`/`test`), cross-compiles all platforms, and publishes the tarball +
`checksums.txt` as a GitHub Release, which the kandev marketplace resolves.
